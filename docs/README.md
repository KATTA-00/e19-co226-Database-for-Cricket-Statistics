## Introduction
### Database for Cricket Statistics

* Cricket is a popular sport played worldwide, with a rich history and a passionate fan
base. The game has evolved significantly, introducing new formats and rules to make it
more exciting and accessible to audiences. With the rise of digital media, there has been
a growing demand for real-time data and analysis on cricket matches, players, and
teams.

* To meet this demand, there is a need for a comprehensive database that can store and
manage information related to cricket. Such a database can track and analyze various
aspects of cricket matches, including player performance, team performance, and match
outcomes. It can also provide valuable insights into the game, enabling fans, analysts,
and teams to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

* The proposed cricket database aims to address this need by providing a platform for
storing and managing information related to cricket matches, players, and stats. It will
allow users to track individual player and team performances, analyze match outcomes,
and gain insights into various aspects of the game. The database will provide a
comprehensive solution for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and teams looking to gain a
competitive edge.

## Purpose of the Database

The purpose of this database is to store, manage and retrieve information about cricket
matches, players, and stats. This can be useful for cricket enthusiasts, fans, coaches, and
analysts who want to study and analyze the sport in greater depth.

A well-designed database can help users to perform various tasks, such as:
* Searching and retrieving player profiles and statistics
* Analyzing team and player performance over time
* Comparing the performance of different teams and players
* Tracking historical records and trends in the sport
* Generating reports and visualizations based on the data
* Making predictions and forecasting for upcoming matches
* Identify emerging talents, practical strategies, and tactics in the sport.

Overall, a cricket database can be a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in the
sport and wants to gain a deeper understanding of its players, teams, and history.
In addition to serving the general user, the database would also be used by players,
team managers, and franchise owners to analyze player statistics and determine which
combination is most likely to win in different circumstances.

## Entities And Attributes

In database design, an object or an entity is a high-level concept representing a set of
related data that must be stored and managed in the database. An object usually
consists of multiple fields or attributes that describe the various properties of that
object. For example, in the case of a cricket database, matches, players, teams, and
venues can all be considered objects because they represent data sets that are related
to each other and need to be stored and managed together.

On the other hand, fields or attributes are individual properties or characteristics of an
object used to describe or distinguish it from other objects. Fields are usually simple
data types representing specific aspects of an object's data, such as text, numbers, or
dates. For example, in the case of a cricket match object, the date, time, toss, captain,
and other related information are all fields that provide more detail about that specific
match object.
